  Fifteen puzzle comes with an HTML skeleton. You are to write the CSS and JS for the assignment, and you won't turn in 
  an HTML file. That means that any changes that you make to the HTML will NOT show up in our turn-in system. You must
  accomplish the assignment using only JS to modify the DOM, and CSS to style the elements.

<div class="ajax-file-listing" data-path="project/fifteen/resources/starter/">Provided HTML file:</div>
<div class="ajax-file-listing" data-path="project/fifteen/resources/images/">Expected output images:</div>

  Course.ajaxFiles();
